# vue-practical-starter-template

> A better Vue.js starter project

This template is based on the official project generated by [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and is 100% compatible with that.
Unfortunately the official template is not very useful and is bare bones so I created this one.

It provides a clean and easy to use (whatever that means) project setup that supports the SPA architecture:

- Router by [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) (Removing hash on the route is possible by using history mode, checkout `./src/router/index.js`)
- Ability to change head tags (including title) by [vue-head](https://github.com/ktquez/vue-head)
- use **sass/scss**, **less** and **stylus** anywhere you want! (`<style lang="[your_lang]"></style>`)
- jQuery 3
- Semantic UI (dist package)

## Build Setup

**Download the zip package from Github or clone this repository.**

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
# packs everything needed to run the app (js, css, fonts and images)
# including things like jQuery and Semantic UI
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
